0,2382,Tue Jun 02 03:15:32 UTC 2009,time warner,floatingatoll,Cox or Time Warner?  Cox is cheaper and gets a B on dslreports.  TW is more expensive and gets a C.

0,2389,Tue Jun 02 03:22:08 UTC 2009,time warner,JohnTurlington,RT @sportsguy33 The upside to Time Warner: unhelpful phone operators   superslow on-site service. Crap, that's not an upside.
0,2390,Tue Jun 02 03:22:19 UTC 2009,time warner,johnscleary,RT @sportsguy33: New Time Warner slogan: Time Warner, where we make you long for the days before cable.
